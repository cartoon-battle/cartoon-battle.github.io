This is an opinionated strategy guide for Animation Throwdown. 

## Contributing 

All contributions and points of view are welcome. For example, it is commonly agreed upon that the best strategy for beating 24th and 25th adventure islands is to knock out the first card. If you however feel that farming 20 Francines and boring AI to death is a valid strategy, I will publish your opinion signed your nickname.
